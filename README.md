# Dread Rising

**An AI Research Companion That Actually Gets It**

Ever tried reading through 14 dense-ass papers only to realize you understood none of them? Yeah, lmao – WELCOME TO THE CLUB BABY!.

## Why DRing?

Research is hard. Tools shouldn't be.
DRing is like a tireless, overcaffeinated postdoc with ADHD and perfect memory, but without the burnout.
Whether you're trying to understand niche math papers or just bluff your way through a lit review, it's here for you . :) 

PS: Like me , I am here for you <3


## What It Does

**Analyze Documents → Discover Connections → Extract Knowledge**

- Automatically highlights the important bits (so you can pretend you read it all)
- Finds related research on arXiv (because who has time for manual searching hell)
- Lets you chat with your documents like you're arguing with your smarter friend
- Remembers your stuff across sessions like an emotionally stable ex
- Cross-checks answers with Google Search (google grounding, always!<make sure to turn it on\>)

## Quick Setup

- Just use the streamlit link lowkey, it's literally the same. But if you wanna do it locally here:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/dread-rising.git
cd dread-rising
pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run main.py
```

Grab a free Gemini API key from Google AI Studio and you're basically ready to summon the beast.

## How It Works

1. Feed It Papers – Drop your PDFs into the pit
2. Ask Away – Chat like you're annoying your research TA
3. Get Insights – DRing pulls out the gold
4. Save Everything – Export your madness so you can return to it later

## Philosophy

Research isn't magic. It's slow, draining, and kind of beautiful.

DRing doesn't try to be your academic overlord,  it just helps you see through the noise, connect ideas, and maybe write something worth reading. It's a tool. A vibe. A slightly usable AI in your browser tab. But we believe Research is yours, so just because DRing helps you think, not cheat. Don't let AI write your paper.   

## Common Issues

- "No API key" → Add your Gemini key in the sidebar
- "PDF won't analyze" → It's probably a scanned image. DRing is smart, not psychic
- "No papers found" → Expand your keywords, check your internet

## Development:

- Check and search for TODOs. You will find some stuff.
